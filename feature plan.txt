MAIN SYSTEM: 
	
	cronos
		Either x86 operating system, or some highly optimized GUI that connects all of the 
		following subsystems
	
	ctrl-room/syns (Music+Audio)
		Using modular synth project as a starting point for developing this

	raylib (Desktop video)
		raylib display includes option for TEXT or GRAPHICS mode
		Works on Windows, Linux
		
		TEXT_DEBUG:	System runs in debug mode, I/O is through the terminal.
		TEXT_DEBUG_MEM:	System runs in debug mode, I/O is through the terminal. Display
				is split in two (terminal, memory). Live memory manipulation,
				reading, updating. Customizable display, able to show list of
				ranges from different parts of mem at the same time
		TEXT_MAIN: 	System runs in 6502 mode, goes through startup sequence 
				and begins executing code. Input/Output is through the terminal
				(dimensions/# of lines TBD)

		GRAPHICS_DEBUG_FULL: 	 System runs in debug mode, display is split in 3 
					 (AV OUT, console, memory). Size and position of subwindows
					 as well as other configuration is available.
		GRAPHICS_DEBUG_TERMINAL: System runs in debug mode, display is split in 2
					 (AV OUT, terminal). Size and position of subwindows
					 as well as other configuration is available.
		GRAPHICS_DEBUG_MEM: 	 System runs in debug mode, display is split in 2
					 (AV OUT, memory). Size and position of subwindows
					 as well as other configuration is available.
		GRAPHICS_MAIN:		 Display is only the virtual AV OUT. I/O is through 						 keyboard, mouse, and any other custom mapped devices 						 (configure in mem). Collapsable sidebar with system 						 controls, settings, etc.
	Arduino (Breadboard Video PHASE 1)
		Using UNO_GRAPHICS from my CEH-UNO repo

	Interface w/ 6502 System (Breadboard Video PHASE 2/FINAL)	
		TEXT MODE:
		GRAPHICS MODE:

	ctrl-6502 (Operating environment)
		Calls functions from the above libraries to pretend to be a computer from 1974!
